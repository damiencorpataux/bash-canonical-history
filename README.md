bash-canonical-history
======================

A **centralized .bash_history** management system so that you will never crave for a bash history line again

### Problem...
**Have you ever been in annoying situations where**
* **you lost your precious history** by crashing your box
* **your history is scattered** across dozens of users / hosts / screens

### Solution !
**A .bash_history file that is**
* **centralized** (using a git repo)
* **hookable** (cleaning, ordering, filtering, regexing definitely)
* **modulable** (per-host history could be kept pristine using git branches etc)
* **handy** (history should reload seamlessly or eye-blinkingly)
* **fun and simple**

### General
Would this be a **git-canonical command** that canonicalizes any file in a flexible way ?
